_The idea of this application comes from an old discussion I had with a dutch man. I told him that it would never be appreciated in France. 
Whatever! He told me, just do the exercice :)
So here is the idea..._

You go to the restaurant with friends, and you split the bill according to your incomes... The one who earn the most pay the most and so on ;)
